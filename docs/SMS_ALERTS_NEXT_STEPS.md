## Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Code Review & Testing Preparation (Today)

#### 1.1 Review Implementation
```bash
# Review all changes
git diff main..feature/sms-alerts-testing-completion

# Review specific components
git show HEAD  # Latest frontend commit
git show HEAD~1  # Backend commit
```

#### 1.2 Clean Up Branch
There are untracked WIP files from Issues #81 and #82 that prevent compilation:
- GlobalRuleController.java
- GlobalAlertController.java
- PluginMarketplaceController.java
- FleetAggregatorService.java
- GlobalRuleEvaluatorService.java
- GlobalRuleService.java
- GlobalAlertService.java

**Options**:
1. **Stash for later**: `git stash -u` (stash untracked files)
2. **Move to separate branch**: Create `feature/global-rules-wip` and commit WIP
3. **Delete if not needed**: Remove and recreate from scratch later

**Recommended**:
```bash
# Create WIP branch for Global Rules/Plugins work
git checkout -b feature/global-rules-wip
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/controller/Global*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/controller/PluginMarketplace*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/service/Global*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/service/FleetAggregator*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/model/Global*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/model/*Plugin*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/dto/Global*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/dto/*Plugin*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/repository/Global*
git add src/main/java/org/indcloud/repository/*Plugin*
git commit -m "WIP: Global Rules and Plugin Marketplace (incomplete)"

# Return to SMS branch
git checkout feature/sms-alerts-testing-completion
```

#### 1.3 Verify Build
```bash
# Backend build
./gradlew clean build

# Frontend build
cd frontend && npm run build
```

### Step 2: Set Up Twilio Test Account (1-2 hours)

#### 2.1 Sign Up for Twilio
1. Go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
2. Sign up for free trial account
3. Verify your email
4. Complete phone verification

#### 2.2 Get Twilio Credentials
1. Navigate to Console Dashboard
2. Copy **Account SID** (starts with AC...)
3. Copy **Auth Token** (click to reveal)
4. Go to Phone Numbers → Buy a Number
5. Select a number (free trial provides 1 number)
6. Copy the phone number (E.164 format: +15551234567)

#### 2.3 Configure Development Environment
Create/update `.env.local`:
```bash

   - Trial accounts have limitations (verified numbers only)
   - Consider upgrading for unrestricted SMS

2. **Purchase Production Number**:
   - Buy dedicated number for production
   - Consider toll-free number for better deliverability

3. **Configure Production Credentials**:

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: SMS Not Sending

**Check**:
1. SMS globally enabled? (admin settings)
2. Organization SMS enabled?
3. Daily limit not exceeded?
4. Monthly budget not exceeded?
5. Twilio credentials correct?
6. Phone number verified?

**Logs**:
```bash
# Backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend | grep -i sms

# Database check
SELECT * FROM sms_delivery_log WHERE status = 'FAILED' ORDER BY sent_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Issue: Verification Code Not Received

**Check**:
1. Phone number in E.164 format?
2. Twilio trial account verified the number?
3. Check Twilio logs at https://console.twilio.com/logs
4. Check backend logs for errors

**Solutions**:
- Use "Resend Code" button
- Check spam/blocked messages
- Verify Twilio balance
- Try different phone number

### Issue: Budget Threshold Email Not Sent

**Check**:
1. Email enabled in settings?
2. SMTP credentials correct?
3. Admin email configured?
4. Budget threshold actually reached?

**Test Email**:
```bash
# Test SMTP connection
telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
```

### Issue: Daily Limit Resetting Incorrectly

**Check**:
- `lastResetDate` in `organization_sms_settings`
- Server timezone configuration
- Counter reset logic in `SmsNotificationService`

**Manual Reset**:
```sql
UPDATE organization_sms_settings
SET current_day_count = 0,
    last_reset_date = NOW()
WHERE organization_id = 1;
```

## Cost Management

### Twilio Pricing (US)
- Standard SMS: $0.0075 per message
- Verification SMS: $0.05 per message
- Toll-free SMS: $0.0125 per message

### Cost Projections
| Alerts/Day | SMS/Month | Cost/Month |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| 10         | 300       | $2.25      |
| 50         | 1,500     | $11.25     |
| 100        | 3,000     | $22.50     |
| 500        | 15,000    | $112.50    |

### Budget Recommendations
1. **Start Conservative**: $25-50/month
2. **Monitor First Month**: Track actual usage
3. **Adjust Based on Data**: Increase if hitting limits
4. **Set Alerts**: 80% threshold recommended
5. **Review Monthly**: Optimize alert frequency
